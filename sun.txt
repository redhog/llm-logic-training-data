The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a
massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by
nuclear fusion reactions in its core. Part of this energy is emitted
from its surface as visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared
radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth. The Sun has
been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central
subject for astronomical research since antiquity.
